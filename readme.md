# Prakriti Analysis ML Model (Still under Development)

Welcome to the Prakriti Analysis ML Model repository! This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for performing analysis and predictions related to the Prakriti domain. The model utilizes various ML techniques to analyze data and make insightful predictions.

## Description

The Prakriti Analysis ML Model aims to provide valuable insights and predictions within the Prakriti domain. Prakriti refers to the individual constitution in Ayurveda, which determines one's physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. This ML model analyzes data related to Prakriti and provides predictions based on the available information.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** The model preprocesses raw data, performs data cleaning, and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** The model extracts relevant features from the dataset to capture meaningful information for analysis and prediction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The model conducts EDA to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset related to Prakriti.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The model employs various ML algorithms, such as regression, classification, or clustering, to train predictive models based on Prakriti data.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model assesses the performance of trained ML models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- **Prediction Generation:** Once the ML models are trained and evaluated, the model generates predictions or classifications based on new input data related to Prakriti.
- **Model Deployment:** The model provides guidelines or scripts for deploying the ML model into a production environment, allowing for real-time predictions or integration with other systems.
